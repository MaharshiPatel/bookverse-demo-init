## CI/CD Flow Overview

The BookVerse platform uses a multi-stage CI/CD process with service-level and platform-level workflows:

**Service Level**: Code Commit → GitHub Workflow → Build/Promote/Release → Trusted Release for Internal Use

**Platform Level**: Bi-weekly Trigger → Aggregate Services → Promote/Release for Public Use → Webhook → K8s Update

### The Actual Process

#### Service Deployment (Individual Services)
1. **Developer commits code** to a service repository (inventory, recommendations, checkout, web)

2. **GitHub workflow triggers automatically** and executes:
   - Build the service
   - Promote through environments
   - Release the application version as a **trusted release for internal use**

#### Platform Aggregation (Bi-weekly)
3. **Bi-weekly GitHub workflow triggers** and executes:
   - Aggregate the latest trusted releases for all internal services
   - Promote the aggregated platform
   - Release for **public use**

#### Kubernetes Deployment
4. **Webhook triggers** the update-k8s workflow in GitHub Actions

5. **ArgoCD updates** the Kubernetes cluster automatically

### Key Characteristics
- **Service Independence**: Each service deploys independently to trusted internal releases
- **Platform Coordination**: Bi-weekly aggregation coordinates all services for public release
- **GitOps Integration**: ArgoCD handles the final Kubernetes deployment
- **Webhook-Driven**: Platform releases automatically trigger infrastructure updates

## Improved CI/CD Process

### 1. Intelligent Commit Filtering

The BookVerse platform automatically analyzes every code commit to determine whether it should trigger a full deployment pipeline or just create build information for tracking purposes.

#### How It Works

When you push code to any BookVerse service repository, the system examines:
1. **Commit Message**: The text description of your changes
2. **Changed Files**: Which specific files were modified
3. **Branch Context**: Which branch the commit was made to

Based on this analysis, the system makes one of two decisions:

#### Decision 1: Create Application Version (Full Pipeline)
**What Happens**: Triggers the complete CI/CD pipeline including build, test, and release as a trusted version for internal use.

**When This Happens**:
- **Feature Commits**: Messages starting with `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`
- **Release Commits**: Messages containing `[release]` or `[version]` tags
- **Main Branch Activity**: Direct pushes to main branch or pull request merges
- **Release Branches**: Commits to `release/*` or `hotfix/*` branches

**Why**: These commits represent meaningful changes that should be deployed and tested through the full pipeline to ensure they reach production safely.

#### Decision 2: Build Info Only (No Deployment)
**What Happens**: Creates a build record for traceability but does NOT trigger deployment pipeline. The code is built and tested, but no new application version is created.

**When This Happens**:
- **Documentation Changes**: Only markdown files or documentation updated
- **Test-Only Changes**: Only test files were modified
- **Explicit Skip**: Developer explicitly requests no deployment

**Why**: These commits don't change the application functionality, so there's no need to create a new version or deploy through environments.

#### Real Examples

| Commit | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `feat: add user profile page` | ✅ **Application Version** | New feature - needs full testing |
| `fix: resolve login timeout issue` | ✅ **Application Version** | Bug fix - needs deployment |
| `docs: update installation guide` | ❌ **Build Info Only** | Documentation only - no code changes |
| `test: add integration tests for API` | ❌ **Build Info Only** | Test improvements - no app changes |
| `refactor: optimize database queries` | ✅ **Application Version** | Performance improvement - needs testing |
| `update README [skip-version]` | ❌ **Build Info Only** | Explicitly requested skip |

#### Why This Matters

**For Developers**:
- **Faster Feedback**: Only meaningful changes trigger full pipeline
- **Reduced Noise**: Documentation updates don't create unnecessary releases
- **Flexibility**: Can override decisions when needed with commit tags

**For Operations**:
- **Resource Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary builds and deployments
- **Clear Audit Trail**: Every commit tracked, but only releases create versions
- **Production Safety**: Only tested, meaningful changes reach production

**For Compliance**:
- **Complete Traceability**: Every commit recorded in build info
- **Version Control**: Clear separation between builds and releases
- **Evidence Collection**: Full audit trail for regulatory requirements

### 2. Service CI/CD Pipeline

Each service (web, inventory, recommendations, checkout) follows this workflow:

#### Triggers:
- **Automatic**: Push to main branch, pull request merge
- **Manual**: Workflow dispatch for testing/debugging

#### Process Flow:
1. **Code Analysis**: Determine commit type and filtering rules
2. **Build & Test**: Standard CI pipeline (build, test, security scan)
3. **Artifact Creation**: 
   - Always: Create build info in JFrog
   - Conditionally: Create application version in AppTrust (based on commit filter)
4. **Release**: If application version created, release as **trusted version for internal use**

#### Key Points:
- **No Environment Promotion**: Services don't promote through DEV/QA/STAGING environments
- **Internal Trusted Releases**: Each service creates trusted releases ready for platform aggregation
- **Independent Deployment**: Services deploy independently without waiting for platform releases

### 3. Platform Aggregation & Release

#### Bi-weekly Scheduled Aggregation:
- **Schedule**: Every second Monday at 09:00 UTC
- **Process**: 
  1. Collect latest trusted releases of all internal services
  2. Build and test the aggregated platform
  3. Create platform manifest
  4. Release for **public use**
  5. Trigger webhook to initiate Kubernetes deployment

#### Webhook-Driven Deployment:
- **Trigger**: Platform release completion automatically sends webhook
- **Target**: update-k8s workflow in GitHub Actions
- **Process**: 
  1. Webhook triggers update-k8s GitHub workflow
  2. Workflow updates Helm charts with new platform versions
  3. ArgoCD detects changes and updates Kubernetes cluster
  4. Rolling deployment with zero downtime

#### Hotfix Capability:
- **Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch or API call
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Critical security patches
  - Production incidents requiring immediate deployment
  - Emergency rollbacks
- **Process**: Same as bi-weekly aggregation but triggered on-demand

## Deployment Process

## Demo-Optimized Automatic Pipeline

**Perfect for demonstrating:**
- Modern CI/CD best practices
- Resilience and error recovery
- JFrog + AppTrust integration
- Kubernetes deployment automation

#### For Service Updates (Demo Flow):
1. **You commit** code changes to any service repository (inventory, recommendations, checkout, web)
   ```bash
   # Example: Fix a bug in the inventory service
   cd bookverse-inventory
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: resolve inventory calculation error"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions automatically triggers** (no manual intervention needed)
   - Detects the `fix:` prefix → classifies as "release-ready"
   - Builds Docker image
   - Runs tests
   - Pushes to JFrog registry

3. **Creates trusted release** for internal use and platform aggregation

#### For Platform Releases (Demo Flow):
1. **Trigger platform aggregation** (manual for demo control):
   ```bash
   # From bookverse-helm repository
   gh workflow run update-k8s.yml
   ```

2. **Platform service automatically**:
   - Collects latest PROD versions: inventory v1.2.3, web v2.1.5, etc.
   - Creates platform manifest
   - Generates platform release v2.1.40

3. **Helm deployment automatically**:
   - Updates `values.yaml` with new image tags
   - Deploys to your local Kubernetes cluster
   - Performs rolling update (zero downtime)

4. **You can immediately verify**:
   ```bash
   # Check deployment status
   kubectl get pods -n bookverse-prod
   
   # Test the updated service via professional demo URL
   curl http://bookverse.demo/api/v1/books
   ```

#### Demo Advantages:

**🎯 Great for Presentations:**
- **Visible Progress**: Watch GitHub Actions workflows in real-time
- **Immediate Results**: Changes appear in your local cluster within minutes
- **Error Recovery**: Demonstrate how the system handles failures gracefully
- **Rollback Demo**: Show automated rollback workflow

**⚡ Fast Iteration:**
- **No Manual Steps**: Commit → Deploy automatically
- **Quick Feedback**: See results in 2-5 minutes
- **Local Testing**: Everything runs on your Mac (no external dependencies)

**🔧 Production-Like:**
- **Same Workflows**: Identical to what you'd use in production
- **Real Tools**: JFrog, AppTrust, Kubernetes - not mock services
- **Authentic Experience**: Demonstrates real enterprise CI/CD

#### Demo Scenarios You Can Show:

1. **Happy Path Deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Make a small change
   echo "// Demo change" >> bookverse-web/src/main.js
   git commit -m "feat: add demo enhancement"
   git push
   # Watch it deploy automatically
   ```

2. **Resilience Recovery:**
   ```bash
   # Simulate a service failure
   kubectl delete pod -l app=inventory -n bookverse-prod
   # Show how the system recovers and maintains availability
   ```


4. **Multi-Service Update:**
   ```bash
   # Update multiple services, watch platform aggregation
   # Show how all services get updated together
   ```

#### For Hotfixes (Demo):
Perfect for showing emergency response:
```bash
# Simulate critical bug fix
git commit -m "fix: critical security patch [hotfix]"
git push

# Trigger immediate platform release
gh workflow run update-k8s.yml --field hotfix=true

# Show deployment completing in under 2 minutes
```

This approach gives you all the benefits of a production CI/CD pipeline while being perfectly suited for demonstration purposes on your local Mac setup.

### Step 1: Build and Push Individual Services

For the web service (our resilience changes):
```bash
cd /path/to/bookverse-web
# Build the image
docker build -t bookverse-web:resilient .
# Tag for JFrog registry
docker tag bookverse-web:resilient apptrustswampupc.jfrog.io/bookverse-web-internal-docker-release-local/web:resilient
# Push to registry (requires authentication)
docker push apptrustswampupc.jfrog.io/bookverse-web-internal-docker-release-local/web:resilient
```

#### Step 2: Update Helm Values Manually

```bash
cd /path/to/bookverse-helm
# Edit values.yaml to pin the new image tag
vim charts/platform/values.yaml
# Update the web.tag field to 'resilient'
```

#### Step 3: Deploy via Helm

```bash
# Deploy to the cluster
helm upgrade platform ./charts/platform -n bookverse-prod
# Verify deployment
kubectl rollout status deployment/platform-web -n bookverse-prod
```

### Method 3: Trigger Helm Workflow Manually

You can trigger the Helm workflow directly:

```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh workflow run update-k8s.yml \
  --repo your-org/bookverse-helm \
  --field platform_version="2.1.38" \
  --field build_number="manual-$(date +%s)"

# Or via GitHub UI
# Go to: https://github.com/your-org/bookverse-helm/actions/workflows/update-k8s.yml
# Click "Run workflow"
```

## Current Deployment Status

Based on the analysis of your current setup:

### Existing Infrastructure
- ✅ **Kubernetes Cluster**: Running with all services
- ✅ **JFrog Artifactory**: Configured with OIDC authentication
- ✅ **AppTrust Platform**: Managing component versions
- ✅ **Helm Charts**: Configured for deployment
- ✅ **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows in place

### Service Status
```bash
# Check current deployments
kubectl get pods -n bookverse-prod
kubectl get services -n bookverse-prod
kubectl get deployments -n bookverse-prod
```

## Deploying the Resilience Improvements

### Quick Deployment (Recommended)

Since you have the infrastructure in place, here's the fastest way to deploy our resilience improvements:

#### 1. Commit Changes
```bash
cd /path/to/bookverse-web
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement comprehensive resilience architecture

- Fix frontend to use relative URLs through nginx proxy
- Enhance nginx configuration with timeouts and retries
- Add proxy parameters for better error handling
- Enable ingress controller for production access
- Add comprehensive monitoring and health checks"
git push origin main
```

#### 2. Trigger Platform Release
```bash
cd /path/to/bookverse-platform
# Update version or trigger release process
# This depends on your specific platform release workflow
```

#### 3. Deploy via Helm Workflow
```bash
# Trigger the Helm deployment workflow
gh workflow run update-k8s.yml --repo your-org/bookverse-helm
```

### Manual Override (Fastest for Testing)

If you want to test immediately:

```bash
# 1. Build and push the web image
cd /path/to/bookverse-web
docker build -t apptrustswampupc.jfrog.io/bookverse-web-internal-docker-release-local/web:resilient-$(date +%s) .
docker push apptrustswampupc.jfrog.io/bookverse-web-internal-docker-release-local/web:resilient-$(date +%s)

# 2. Update the deployment directly
kubectl set image deployment/platform-web web=apptrustswampupc.jfrog.io/bookverse-web-internal-docker-release-local/web:resilient-$(date +%s) -n bookverse-prod

# 3. Wait for rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment/platform-web -n bookverse-prod
```

## Monitoring and Verification

### Health Checks
```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n bookverse-prod

# Check service endpoints
kubectl port-forward svc/platform-web 8080:80 -n bookverse-prod &
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Check application functionality
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/books?page=1&per_page=5
```

### Logs and Debugging
```bash
# Web application logs
kubectl logs deployment/platform-web -n bookverse-prod

# Service connectivity test
kubectl exec deployment/platform-web -n bookverse-prod -- wget -qO- http://inventory/api/v1/books?page=1&per_page=1

# Nginx configuration verification
kubectl exec deployment/platform-web -n bookverse-prod -- nginx -t
```

## Rollback Procedures

The BookVerse platform includes an automated rollback workflow that handles deployment rollbacks safely and efficiently.

### Automated Rollback Workflow

**Trigger**: Use the dedicated rollback workflow when you need to revert to a previous version.

**How to Execute**:
```bash
# Trigger the rollback workflow
gh workflow run rollback.yml --repo your-org/bookverse-helm \
  --field service="platform" \
  --field target_version="previous"

# Or rollback to a specific version
gh workflow run rollback.yml --repo your-org/bookverse-helm \
  --field service="inventory" \
  --field target_version="v1.2.3"
```


**What the Workflow Does**:
1. **Validates** the target version exists and is deployable
2. **Updates** Helm values to the specified version
3. **Deploys** the rollback through the normal deployment pipeline
4. **Verifies** the rollback was successful
5. **Notifies** the team of rollback completion

### Benefits of Automated Rollback
- **Safe**: Uses the same tested deployment pipeline
- **Traceable**: Creates full audit trail of the rollback
- **Verified**: Includes health checks and validation
- **Consistent**: Same process whether rolling forward or backward

### Emergency Rollback
For critical situations, the rollback workflow can be triggered immediately and will bypass normal approval gates while maintaining full traceability.



## Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. **Feature Branch**: Create feature branch for changes
2. **Local Testing**: Test changes locally with docker-compose
3. **PR Review**: Submit pull request for code review
4. **Staging Deploy**: Deploy to staging environment first
5. **Production Deploy**: Deploy to production after validation

### Production Deployment
1. **Blue-Green**: Use blue-green deployment for zero downtime
2. **Health Checks**: Always verify health endpoints after deployment
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor error rates and response times
4. **Rollback Plan**: Have rollback procedure ready

### Security
1. **OIDC Authentication**: Use OIDC tokens, not static credentials
2. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimal required permissions
3. **Secret Management**: Store secrets in Kubernetes secrets
4. **Image Scanning**: Scan images for vulnerabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues


#### 2. Service connectivity issues
```bash
# Test internal service connectivity
kubectl exec deployment/platform-web -n bookverse-prod -- nslookup inventory
kubectl exec deployment/platform-web -n bookverse-prod -- wget -qO- http://inventory/health
```

#### 3. Image pull errors
```bash
# Check image pull secrets
kubectl get secrets -n bookverse-prod
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n bookverse-prod
```

#### 4. Helm deployment failures
```bash
# Check Helm release status
helm status platform -n bookverse-prod
helm get values platform -n bookverse-prod
```

## Phase 1: Enable Automatic Triggers (Immediate)

1. **Update Service CI Workflows**:
   ```bash
   # For each service repository (inventory, recommendations, checkout, web)
   # Update .github/workflows/ci.yml to change from:
   on:
     workflow_dispatch:
   # To:
   on:
     push:
       branches: [main]
     pull_request:
       branches: [main]
     workflow_dispatch:  # Keep for manual testing
   ```

2. **Add Commit Filtering Logic**:
   - Create new job `analyze-commit` in each service CI workflow
   - Implement commit message and file change analysis
   - Set conditional execution for application version creation

### Phase 2: Implement Auto-Promotion (Week 1-2)

1. **Create Promotion Workflows**:
   - Add automatic promotion triggers after successful CI
   - Implement service-to-platform aggregation workflow
   - Add configurable delays and approval gates

2. **Configure Repository Dispatch**:
   - Set up cross-repository triggers
   - Enable service CI to trigger promotion workflows

### Phase 3: Enable Platform Aggregation (Week 2-3)

1. **Enable Scheduled Aggregation**:
   ```yaml
   # In bookverse-platform/.github/workflows/aggregate.yml
   # Uncomment the schedule trigger:
   schedule:
     - cron: '0 9 */14 * 1'  # Every second Monday at 09:00 UTC
   ```

2. **Add Hotfix Capability**:
   - Enhance platform aggregation workflow with hotfix input
   - Create API endpoint or webhook for emergency triggers
   - Add notification system for hotfix deployments

### Phase 4: Complete Automation (Week 3-4)

1. **Integrate Helm Auto-Deployment**:
   - Connect platform releases to Helm workflow triggers
   - Add deployment verification and rollback capabilities
   - Implement blue-green deployment strategy

2. **Add Monitoring & Alerting**:
   - Set up deployment success/failure notifications
   - Implement health checks and automatic rollback
   - Add metrics collection for deployment frequency and success rates

### Demo Implementation Examples

#### Demo-Optimized Commit Filter:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/analyze-commit-demo.sh
# =============================================================================
# DEMO-OPTIMIZED COMMIT ANALYSIS
# =============================================================================
# This script is optimized for demonstration purposes to show CI/CD workflows
# in action. Production systems would use more conservative defaults.
#
# DEMO BEHAVIOR: Favors creating application versions for visibility
# PRODUCTION BEHAVIOR: Would default to build-info-only for safety
# =============================================================================

COMMIT_MSG="${1:-$(git log -1 --pretty=%B)}"
CHANGED_FILES="${2:-$(git diff --name-only HEAD~1)}"

echo "🎯 DEMO MODE: Analyzing commit for CI/CD demonstration"
echo "📝 Commit: $COMMIT_MSG"

# Demo: Simple rules for clarity (production would have 10-15 rules)
if [[ "$COMMIT_MSG" =~ \[skip-version\] ]]; then
  echo "create_version=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  echo "🔨 Demo: Build info only (explicit skip)"
  # PRODUCTION NOTE: Would have many more skip patterns
  
elif [[ "$COMMIT_MSG" =~ ^docs?: ]] && [[ "$CHANGED_FILES" =~ ^[[:space:]]*$ || $(echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | grep -v '\.md$\|^docs/' | wc -l) -eq 0 ]]; then
  echo "create_version=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  echo "🔨 Demo: Build info only (docs-only)"
  # PRODUCTION NOTE: Would include README, wikis, comments, etc.
  
elif [[ "$COMMIT_MSG" =~ ^test?: ]] && [[ $(echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | grep -v '^tests\?/\|_test\.' | wc -l) -eq 0 ]]; then
  echo "create_version=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  echo "🔨 Demo: Build info only (tests-only)"
  # PRODUCTION NOTE: Would include spec files, fixtures, mocks, etc.
  
else
  # DEMO DEFAULT: Create application version for pipeline visibility
  echo "create_version=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  echo "✅ Demo: Creating app version (showing full pipeline)"
  echo "📝 Production note: Real systems would default to build-info-only here"
fi

# =============================================================================
# PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION (for reference):
# =============================================================================
# Production systems would use conservative defaults:
#
# echo "create_version=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT  # Safe default
# 
# # Only create versions for explicit release-ready patterns:
# if [[ "$COMMIT_MSG" =~ ^(feat|fix|perf)!?: ]] ||     # Breaking changes
#    [[ "$COMMIT_MSG" =~ \[release\] ]] ||              # Explicit release
#    [[ "$GITHUB_REF" =~ ^refs/heads/(release|hotfix)/ ]] || # Release branches
#    [[ semantic_version_bump_detected ]]; then         # Automated detection
#   echo "create_version=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
# fi
```

#### Demo vs Production Monitoring:

**Demo Approach (Current):**
```bash
# Simple logging for demo visibility
echo "🎯 DEMO: Decision made - $DECISION"
echo "📊 Reason: $REASON" 
echo "🚀 Watch the pipeline in GitHub Actions!"

# PRODUCTION would add:
# - Structured JSON logging
# - Metrics collection (Prometheus/DataDog)
# - Decision audit trail
# - Team notification integration
# - False positive/negative tracking
```

#### Auto-Promotion Workflow:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/promote-auto.yml
name: Auto-Promote
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      app_version:
        required: true
        type: string
      from_stage:
        required: true
        type: string
      to_stage:
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  promote:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Promote Application
        run: |
          # Call AppTrust promotion API
          # Add stage-specific validation
          # Trigger next stage if successful
```

## Demo vs Production Considerations

### Demo Environment (Local K8s on Mac)
For demonstration purposes, the focus is on showcasing the CI/CD workflow and resilience patterns:

**What's Important for Demo:**
- ✅ **Automatic deployments** that work reliably
- ✅ **Visible workflow progression** (easy to demonstrate)
- ✅ **Quick iteration cycles** (fast feedback for demos)
- ✅ **Local accessibility** (port-forward, localhost access)
- ✅ **Resilience demonstration** (show error recovery)

**What's NOT Needed for Demo:**
- ❌ SSL/TLS certificates (localhost doesn't need HTTPS)
- ❌ Horizontal pod autoscaling (single replicas are fine)
- ❌ Production monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana overhead)
- ❌ External load balancers (port-forward is sufficient)
- ❌ Persistent volumes (demo data can be ephemeral)

### Production Environment
For real production deployment, you would add:
- SSL/TLS with cert-manager
- Horizontal pod autoscaling  
- Production monitoring stack
- External ingress with real domains
- Persistent storage and backup strategies

### Key Differences: Demo vs Production

| Aspect | Demo (Local K8s on Mac) | Production |
|--------|-------------------------|------------|
| **Access Method** | `kubectl port-forward` + `localhost:8080` | External load balancer + real domain |
| **SSL/TLS** | Not needed (localhost) | Required with certificates |
| **Scaling** | Single replica per service | Multiple replicas + autoscaling |
| **Storage** | EmptyDir volumes (ephemeral) | Persistent volumes + backups |
| **Monitoring** | kubectl logs + basic health checks | Prometheus, Grafana, alerting |
| **Network** | ClusterIP services + port-forward | Ingress controller + external IPs |
| **Resource Limits** | Minimal (demo data) | Production-sized limits |
| **High Availability** | Single node (your Mac) | Multi-node cluster |
| **Disaster Recovery** | Git restore + redeploy | Backup/restore procedures |
| **Security** | Basic (demo environment) | Network policies, RBAC, secrets |

### Why This Demo Setup is Perfect:

1. **🚀 Fast Setup**: No external dependencies or complex networking
2. **💻 Runs Anywhere**: Works on any Mac with Docker Desktop + Kubernetes
3. **🔄 Quick Iterations**: Make changes and see results in minutes
4. **📊 Real Tools**: Uses actual JFrog, AppTrust, and Kubernetes (not mocks)
5. **🎯 Demo-Friendly**: Easy to show, explain, and troubleshoot
6. **📈 Scalable Concept**: Same patterns work in production with more resources
