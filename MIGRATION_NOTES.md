# BookVerse Demo Assets Migration Notes

## Migration Completed: September 14, 2025

The `bookverse-demo-assets` repository has been successfully migrated to be a subfolder under `bookverse-demo-init`.

### Changes Made:

1. **Directory Structure**: 
   - Created `repos/` directory under `bookverse-demo-init`
   - Moved `bookverse-demo-assets` content to `repos/bookverse-demo-assets/`

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated `README.md` to reflect new structure
   - Updated `docs/REPO_ARCHITECTURE.md` 
   - Updated `docs/DEMO_RUNBOOK.md`
   - Updated `docs/SWITCH_JFROG_PLATFORM.md`
   - Updated `docs/EVIDENCE_KEY_DEPLOYMENT.md`

3. **Script Updates**:
   - Updated `scripts/update_evidence_keys.sh` to reference `repos/bookverse-demo-assets`
   - Updated `scripts/switch_jfrog_platform_interactive.sh` to reference new path

4. **GitOps Configurations**:
   - **CONSOLIDATED**: Merged comprehensive multi-environment GitOps configurations into main `gitops/` folder
   - Now includes all environments: dev, qa, staging, prod (13 total files)
   - Updated repository references to point to `bookverse-demo-init`
   - Removed redundant GitOps files from `repos/bookverse-demo-assets/gitops/`

### Workspace Configuration:

The VS Code workspace (`bookverse.code-workspace`) now correctly references:
```json
{ "path": "repos/bookverse-demo-assets" }
```

### GitOps Consolidation Completed:

✅ **Unified GitOps Structure**: 
   - Consolidated from 5 files (prod-only) + 10 files (all environments) → 13 files (comprehensive)
   - Single `gitops/` folder now contains all environment configurations
   - Multi-environment support: DEV, QA, STAGING, PROD
   - Updated bootstrap configurations for all namespaces

### Next Steps:

1. **Repository Cleanup**:
   - The original `bookverse-demo-assets` repository can now be archived/deleted
   - All references now point to the subfolder structure

### Benefits:

- ✅ Consolidated repository structure
- ✅ Single clone operation gets all demo materials
- ✅ Workspace configuration works correctly
- ✅ All scripts and documentation updated
- ✅ Maintains all GitOps configurations and demo assets
