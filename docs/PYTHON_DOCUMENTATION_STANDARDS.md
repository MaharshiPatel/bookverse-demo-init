    🧪 Usage Examples:
        Basic book operations:
        ```python
        # Initialize service with database session
        book_service = BookService(db_session)
        
        # Create a new book
        book_data = BookCreate(
            title="Python Mastery",
            author="Jane Smith",
            isbn="978-0123456789",
            price=29.99
        )
        new_book = await book_service.create_book(book_data)
        
        # Search for books
        results = await book_service.search_books(
            query="python programming",
            genre="technology",
            min_price=20.0

                    - Search index unavailable
                    - Query complexity exceeds limits
    
    Examples:
        Basic text search:
        ```python
        books, total = await book_service.search_books(
            query="python programming"
        )
        print(f"Found {total} books matching 'python programming'")
        ```
        
        Advanced filtering:
        ```python
        books, total = await book_service.search_books(
            genre="technology",
            min_price=20.0,
            max_price=50.0,
            sort_by="rating",
            sort_order="desc",
            limit=10
        )
        ```
        
        Pagination example:
        ```python
        page_size = 20
        page_number = 3
        offset = (page_number - 1) * page_size
        
        books, total = await book_service.search_books(
            query="machine learning",
            limit=page_size,
            offset=offset
        )
        
        total_pages = math.ceil(total / page_size)
        ```
    
    Performance Notes:
        - Typical response time: 50-150ms depending on complexity
        - Cached results return in < 10ms
        - Large result sets (>10k matches) may take longer
        - Consider using filters to narrow results for better performance
    
    Cache Behavior:
        - Search results cached for 5 minutes
        - Cache key includes all search parameters
        - Cache invalidated when catalog is updated
        - Cached results include both books and total count
    
    Database Queries:
        This method typically generates 1-2 database queries:
        1. Main search query with COUNT() for total results
        2. Optional query for additional metadata if needed
        
        Example generated SQL (simplified):
        ```sql
        SELECT books.*, COUNT(*) OVER() as total_count
        FROM books 
        WHERE title ILIKE '%python%' 
          AND genre = 'technology'
          AND price BETWEEN 20.0 AND 50.0
        ORDER BY rating DESC, title ASC
        LIMIT 20 OFFSET 40;
        ```
    
    Security Considerations:
        - All input parameters are sanitized to prevent SQL injection
        - Search queries are limited to prevent DoS attacks
        - No sensitive data exposed in search results
        - Access control enforced at service layer
    
    Related Methods:
        - get_book(): Retrieve single book by ID
        - get_books_by_genre(): Optimized genre-only search
        - get_trending_books(): Popular books algorithm
        - check_availability(): Stock status for search results

        - JWT_SECRET_KEY must be at least 32 characters for security
        - Database URL must be valid format with proper credentials
        - Service URLs must be valid HTTP/HTTPS endpoints
        - Numeric values must be within acceptable ranges
        - Boolean values accept: true/false, yes/no, 1/0
    
    Error Handling:
        - Missing required variables raise ConfigurationError
        - Invalid values raise ValidationError with helpful messages
        - Security violations logged and raise SecurityError
        - Configuration warnings logged for deprecated settings
    
    Usage in Application:
        ```python
        # Load configuration at startup
        config = InventoryConfig()
        
        # Access configuration values
        database_url = config.database_url
        jwt_secret = config.jwt_secret_key
        
        # Use in service initialization
        app = create_app(config)
        database = init_database(config.database_url)
        ```
    
    Environment-Specific Defaults:
        Development:
        - AUTH_ENABLED=false (for easier testing)
        - DATABASE_ECHO=true (for query debugging)
        - LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG (for detailed logging)
        
        Production:
        - AUTH_ENABLED=true (security required)
        - DATABASE_ECHO=false (performance)
        - LOG_LEVEL=INFO (operational logging)
