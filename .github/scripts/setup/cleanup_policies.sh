# BookVerse Platform - Unified Policy Cleanup Script
# =============================================================================
#
# This script safely removes all BookVerse unified policies during platform
# cleanup operations, ensuring complete removal of policy configurations
# while maintaining data integrity and proper cleanup sequencing.
#
# üóëÔ∏è CLEANUP OPERATIONS:
#     - Policy Identification: Locate all BookVerse project policies
#     - Safe Removal: Remove policies in proper dependency order
#     - Verification: Confirm complete policy removal
#     - Error Handling: Robust error handling for cleanup operations
#
# Authors: BookVerse Platform Team
