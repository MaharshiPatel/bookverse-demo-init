## CI/CD Flow Overview

The BookVerse platform uses a multi-stage CI/CD process with service-level and platform-level workflows:

**Service Level**: Code Commit ‚Üí GitHub Workflow ‚Üí Build/Promote/Release ‚Üí Trusted Release for Internal Use

**Platform Level**: Bi-weekly Trigger ‚Üí Aggregate Services ‚Üí Promote/Release for Public Use ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí K8s Update

### The Actual Process

#### Service Deployment (Individual Services)
1. **Developer commits code** to a service repository (inventory, recommendations, checkout, web)

2. **GitHub workflow triggers automatically** and executes:
   - Build the service
   - Promote through environments
   - Release the application version as a **trusted release for internal use**

#### Platform Aggregation (Bi-weekly)
3. **Bi-weekly GitHub workflow triggers** and executes:
   - Aggregate the latest trusted releases for all internal services
   - Promote the aggregated platform
   - Release for **public use**

#### Kubernetes Deployment
4. **Webhook triggers** the update-k8s workflow in GitHub Actions

5. **ArgoCD updates** the Kubernetes cluster automatically

### Key Characteristics
- **Service Independence**: Each service deploys independently to trusted internal releases
- **Platform Coordination**: Bi-weekly aggregation coordinates all services for public release
- **GitOps Integration**: ArgoCD handles the final Kubernetes deployment
- **Webhook-Driven**: Platform releases automatically trigger infrastructure updates

## Improved CI/CD Process

### 1. Intelligent Commit Filtering

The BookVerse platform automatically analyzes every code commit to determine whether it should trigger a full deployment pipeline or just create build information for tracking purposes.

#### How It Works

When you push code to any BookVerse service repository, the system examines:
1. **Commit Message**: The text description of your changes
2. **Changed Files**: Which specific files were modified
3. **Branch Context**: Which branch the commit was made to

Based on this analysis, the system makes one of two decisions:

#### Decision 1: Create Application Version (Full Pipeline)
**What Happens**: Triggers the complete CI/CD pipeline including build, test, and release as a trusted version for internal use.

**When This Happens**:
- **Feature Commits**: Messages starting with `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`
- **Release Commits**: Messages containing `[release]` or `[version]` tags
- **Main Branch Activity**: Direct pushes to main branch or pull request merges
- **Release Branches**: Commits to `release/*` or `hotfix/*` branches

**Why**: These commits represent meaningful changes that should be deployed and tested through the full pipeline to ensure they reach production safely.

#### Decision 2: Build Info Only (No Deployment)
**What Happens**: Creates a build record for traceability but does NOT trigger deployment pipeline. The code is built and tested, but no new application version is created.

**When This Happens**:
- **Documentation Changes**: Only markdown files or documentation updated
- **Test-Only Changes**: Only test files were modified
- **Explicit Skip**: Developer explicitly requests no deployment

**Why**: These commits don't change the application functionality, so there's no need to create a new version or deploy through environments.

#### Real Examples

| Commit | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `feat: add user profile page` | ‚úÖ **Application Version** | New feature - needs full testing |
| `fix: resolve login timeout issue` | ‚úÖ **Application Version** | Bug fix - needs deployment |
| `docs: update installation guide` | ‚ùå **Build Info Only** | Documentation only - no code changes |
| `test: add integration tests for API` | ‚ùå **Build Info Only** | Test improvements - no app changes |
| `refactor: optimize database queries` | ‚úÖ **Application Version** | Performance improvement - needs testing |
| `update README [skip-version]` | ‚ùå **Build Info Only** | Explicitly requested skip |

#### Why This Matters

**For Developers**:
- **Faster Feedback**: Only meaningful changes trigger full pipeline
- **Reduced Noise**: Documentation updates don't create unnecessary releases
- **Flexibility**: Can override decisions when needed with commit tags

**For Operations**:
- **Resource Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary builds and deployments
- **Clear Audit Trail**: Every commit tracked, but only releases create versions
- **Production Safety**: Only tested, meaningful changes reach production

**For Compliance**:
- **Complete Traceability**: Every commit recorded in build info
- **Version Control**: Clear separation between builds and releases
- **Evidence Collection**: Full audit trail for regulatory requirements

### 2. Service CI/CD Pipeline

Each service (web, inventory, recommendations, checkout) follows this workflow:

#### Triggers:
- **Automatic**: Push to main branch, pull request merge
- **Manual**: Workflow dispatch for testing/debugging

#### Process Flow:
1. **Code Analysis**: Determine commit type and filtering rules
2. **Build & Test**: Standard CI pipeline (build, test, security scan)
3. **Artifact Creation**: 
   - Always: Create build info in JFrog
   - Conditionally: Create application version in AppTrust (based on commit filter)
4. **Release**: If application version created, release as **trusted version for internal use**

#### Key Points:
- **No Environment Promotion**: Services don't promote through DEV/QA/STAGING environments
- **Internal Trusted Releases**: Each service creates trusted releases ready for platform aggregation
- **Independent Deployment**: Services deploy independently without waiting for platform releases

### 3. Platform Aggregation & Release

#### Bi-weekly Scheduled Aggregation:
- **Schedule**: Every second Monday at 09:00 UTC
- **Process**: 
  1. Collect latest trusted releases of all internal services
  2. Build and test the aggregated platform
  3. Create platform manifest
  4. Release for **public use**
  5. Trigger webhook to initiate Kubernetes deployment

#### Webhook-Driven Deployment:
- **Trigger**: Platform release completion automatically sends webhook
- **Target**: update-k8s workflow in GitHub Actions
- **Process**: 
  1. Webhook triggers update-k8s GitHub workflow
  2. Workflow updates Helm charts with new platform versions
  3. ArgoCD detects changes and updates Kubernetes cluster
  4. Rolling deployment with zero downtime

#### Hotfix Capability:
- **Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch or API call
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Critical security patches
  - Production incidents requiring immediate deployment
  - Emergency rollbacks
- **Process**: Same as bi-weekly aggregation but triggered on-demand

## Deployment Process

### For Service Updates (Demo Flow):
1. **You commit** code changes to any service repository (inventory, recommendations, checkout, web)
   ```bash
   # Example: Fix a bug in the inventory service
   cd bookverse-inventory
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: resolve inventory calculation error"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions automatically triggers** (no manual intervention needed)
   - Detects the `fix:` prefix ‚Üí classifies as "release-ready"
   - Builds Docker image
   - Runs tests
   - Pushes to JFrog registry

3. **Creates trusted release** for internal use and platform aggregation

#### Demo Advantages:

**üéØ Great for Presentations:**
- **Visible Progress**: Watch GitHub Actions workflows in real-time
- **Immediate Results**: Changes appear in your local cluster within minutes
- **Error Recovery**: Demonstrate how the system handles failures gracefully
- **Rollback Demo**: Show automated rollback workflow

**‚ö° Fast Iteration:**
- **No Manual Steps**: Commit ‚Üí Deploy automatically
- **Quick Feedback**: See results in 2-5 minutes
- **Local Testing**: Everything runs on your Mac (no external dependencies)

**üîß Production-Like:**
- **Same Workflows**: Identical to what you'd use in production
- **Real Tools**: JFrog, AppTrust, Kubernetes - not mock services
- **Authentic Experience**: Demonstrates real enterprise CI/CD

#### Demo Scenarios You Can Show:

1. **Happy Path Deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Make a small change
   echo "// Demo change" >> bookverse-web/src/main.js
   git commit -m "feat: add demo enhancement"
   git push
   # Watch it deploy automatically
   ```



4. **Multi-Service Update:**
   ```bash
   # Update multiple services, watch platform aggregation
   # Show how all services get updated together
   ```

#### For Hotfixes (Demo):
Perfect for showing emergency response:
```bash
# Simulate critical bug fix
git commit -m "fix: critical security patch [hotfix]"
git push

# Trigger immediate platform release
gh workflow run update-k8s.yml --field hotfix=true

# Show deployment completing in under 2 minutes
```

This approach gives you all the benefits of a production CI/CD pipeline while being perfectly suited for demonstration purposes on your local Mac setup.

### Step 1: Build and Push Individual Services

For the web service (our resilience changes):
```bash
cd /path/to/bookverse-web
# Build the image
docker build -t bookverse-web:resilient .
# Tag for JFrog registry
docker tag bookverse-web:resilient apptrustswampupc.jfrog.io/bookverse-web-internal-docker-release-local/web:resilient
# Push to registry (requires authentication)
docker push apptrustswampupc.jfrog.io/bookverse-web-internal-docker-release-local/web:resilient
```

## Current Deployment Status

Based on the analysis of your current setup:

### Existing Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Kubernetes Cluster**: Running with all services
- ‚úÖ **JFrog Artifactory**: Configured with OIDC authentication
- ‚úÖ **AppTrust Platform**: Managing component versions
- ‚úÖ **Helm Charts**: Configured for deployment
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows in place


## Deploying the Resilience Improvements

### Quick Deployment (Recommended)

Since you have the infrastructure in place, here's the fastest way to deploy our resilience improvements:

#### 1. Commit Changes
```bash
cd /path/to/bookverse-web
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement comprehensive resilience architecture

- Fix frontend to use relative URLs through nginx proxy
- Enhance nginx configuration with timeouts and retries
- Add proxy parameters for better error handling
- Enable ingress controller for production access
- Add comprehensive monitoring and health checks"
git push origin main
```

#### 2. Trigger Platform Release
```bash
cd /path/to/bookverse-platform
# Update version or trigger release process
# This depends on your specific platform release workflow
```

#### 3. Deploy via Helm Workflow
```bash
# Trigger the Helm deployment workflow
gh workflow run update-k8s.yml --repo your-org/bookverse-helm
```

## Health Checks
```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n bookverse-prod

# Check service endpoints
kubectl port-forward svc/platform-web 8080:80 -n bookverse-prod &
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Check application functionality
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/books?page=1&per_page=5
```

### Logs and Debugging
```bash
# Web application logs
kubectl logs deployment/platform-web -n bookverse-prod

# Service connectivity test
kubectl exec deployment/platform-web -n bookverse-prod -- wget -qO- http://inventory/api/v1/books?page=1&per_page=1

# Nginx configuration verification
kubectl exec deployment/platform-web -n bookverse-prod -- nginx -t
```

## Rollback Procedures

The BookVerse platform includes a user-triggered rollback workflow that handles deployment rollbacks safely and efficiently.

### User-Triggered Rollback Workflow

**Trigger**: Use the dedicated rollback workflow when you need to revert to a previous version.

**How to Execute**:
```bash
# Trigger the rollback workflow
gh workflow run rollback.yml --repo your-org/bookverse-helm \
  --field service="platform" \
  --field target_version="previous"

# Or rollback to a specific version
gh workflow run rollback.yml --repo your-org/bookverse-helm \
  --field service="inventory" \
  --field target_version="v1.2.3"
```


**What the Workflow Does**:
1. **Validates** the target version exists and is deployable
2. **Updates** Helm values to the specified version
3. **Deploys** the rollback through the normal deployment pipeline
4. **Verifies** the rollback was successful
5. **Notifies** the team of rollback completion

### Benefits of Workflow-Based Rollback
- **Safe**: Uses the same tested deployment pipeline
- **Traceable**: Creates full audit trail of the rollback
- **Verified**: Includes health checks and validation
- **Consistent**: Same process whether rolling forward or backward

### Emergency Rollback
For critical situations, the rollback workflow can be triggered immediately and will bypass normal approval gates while maintaining full traceability.



## Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. **Feature Branch**: Create feature branch for changes
2. **Local Testing**: Test changes locally with docker-compose
3. **PR Review**: Submit pull request for code review
4. **Staging Deploy**: Deploy to staging environment first
5. **Production Deploy**: Deploy to production after validation

### Production Deployment
1. **Blue-Green**: Use blue-green deployment for zero downtime
2. **Health Checks**: Always verify health endpoints after deployment
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor error rates and response times
4. **Rollback Plan**: Have rollback procedure ready

### Security
1. **OIDC Authentication**: Use OIDC tokens, not static credentials
2. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimal required permissions
3. **Secret Management**: Store secrets in Kubernetes secrets
4. **Image Scanning**: Scan images for vulnerabilities

## Demo Environment (Local K8s on Mac)
For demonstration purposes, the focus is on showcasing the CI/CD workflow and resilience patterns:

**What's Important for Demo:**
- ‚úÖ **Automatic deployments** that work reliably
- ‚úÖ **Visible workflow progression** (easy to demonstrate)
- ‚úÖ **Quick iteration cycles** (fast feedback for demos)
- ‚úÖ **Local accessibility** (port-forward, localhost access)
- ‚úÖ **Resilience demonstration** (show error recovery)

**What's NOT Needed for Demo:**
- ‚ùå SSL/TLS certificates (localhost doesn't need HTTPS)
- ‚ùå Horizontal pod autoscaling (single replicas are fine)
- ‚ùå Production monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana overhead)
- ‚ùå External load balancers (port-forward is sufficient)
- ‚ùå Persistent volumes (demo data can be ephemeral)

### Production Environment
For real production deployment, you would add:
- SSL/TLS with cert-manager
- Horizontal pod autoscaling  
- Production monitoring stack
- External ingress with real domains
- Persistent storage and backup strategies

### Why This Demo Setup is Perfect:

1. **üöÄ Fast Setup**: No external dependencies or complex networking
2. **üíª Runs Anywhere**: Works on any Mac with Docker Desktop + Kubernetes
3. **üîÑ Quick Iterations**: Make changes and see results in minutes
4. **üìä Real Tools**: Uses actual JFrog, AppTrust, and Kubernetes (not mocks)
5. **üéØ Demo-Friendly**: Easy to show, explain, and troubleshoot
6. **üìà Scalable Concept**: Same patterns work in production with more resources
